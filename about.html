                    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in information Technology, where i have built a strong academic foundation in core computing principles.
                My coursework has provided me with a solid understanding of programming logic, database management, and network fundamentals. 
                This knowledge serves as the bedrock for my specialized interests in web application development and cybersecurity, areas iam actively deepening through self-directed projects and research into modern
                frameworks and security protocols.</p>
